# SVG-presentation-maker

This tool makes a powerpoint-style presentation using a SVG image from a markdown template

- No software needed, just chrome.
- it embeds other SVGs, so they animate in the presentation, can even be interactive
- image files are linked, not included

## Why??

- Was made for a presentation about how powerful and flexible SVGs are.
- Procrastination!

## Notes

- When you use it, Chrome has a warning "Files will be uploaded" - this is not true. All processing happens locally in the html page.
- It works locally with no internet access
