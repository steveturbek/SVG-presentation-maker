# SVG-presentation-maker

A HTML/JavaScript page that makes powerpoint-style presentations in SVG file.

This is a Proof of Concept, but it works! Many features needed before this is a real product.

[see simple template presentation](http://turbek.com/SVG-presentation-maker/files/presentation-output.svg)

## Features

- Write slide content in markdown template
- Design your template in a design tool like Figma/ Illustrator / TextEdit / VSCode
- No software needed, just chrome.
- SVGs are embedded, so they animate in the presentation, can even be interactive
- Image files are linked, not included

## Why??

- Was made for a presentation about how powerful and flexible SVGs are.
- File is tiny!
- Procrastination!

## Notes

- When you use it, Chrome has a warning "Files will be uploaded" - this is not true. All processing happens locally in the html page with no internet access. No information is transmitted or retained.
